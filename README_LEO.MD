# Moore's Voting Algorithm

### Repository: [TheAlgorithms - Java](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Java)

### Feature Request:
**Add Moore's Voting Algorithm TheAlgorithms#5636**  
This feature request proposes adding Moore's Voting Algorithm to the repository. This algorithm is widely used to find the majority element in an array.

---

## Algorithm Overview

The **Moore's Voting Algorithm** is an efficient method for determining the majority element in an array. 

It iterates throught the array, finding a potential candidate for the majority element. It then traverses the array again to verify if candidate
is the majority element.

## Implementation Details

The implementation will include:
- A **standard use case** for finding a majority element.
- A **detailed explanation** of the algorithmâ€™s time and space complexity.
- **Test cases** to validate the correctness and functionality of the algorithm.
